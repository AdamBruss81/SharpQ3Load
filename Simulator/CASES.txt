This is a record of the cases that have been completed or require completion in the future

1. Transfer simulator to tao framework - DONE

2. Reformat code style - DONE, fix upside down textures - DONE
 
3. Remove all casting and replace with templatized lists using the List collection class. Also use members when possible
instead of allocating memory. - DONE, smooth and speed up texturing. using mipmaps things look pretty good. Game moves very slow still
Will try to alter structural aspects of game to speed things up. -DONE

4. Remove all texture flickering. This is most noticable when turning orientation with mouse turns. -DONE 

CollisionDetection-1 : reinstate collision detection - DONE, Tune up collision detection for faster performance, remove all unnecessary allocation of memory
Do it once at load time - DONE but still slow. will try better keyboard movement techniques - DONE

5. Re-import all Quake 3 stock textures and effects from raw pak data. Don't need to convert any images this time because I think C# can read in pngs

6. Implement crude effects for projectiles. Basic idea is to do something cool looking that sticks with projectile as it moves

7. Implement sound emanating from projectile - DONE

8. Handle long map name when it doesn't exist. Remove "aka" before the available map name - DONE

9. Holding shift key flies faster - DONE

10. Wait cursor for map load. And a loading screen that at a minimum displays the status of the bounding box creation and map reading - DONE

11. Collision Detection-2 : Improve collision detection coverage and speed. - DONE

12. Implement a help screen to display what all the keys and mouse commands do. Either do a windows style dialog or something fancier with the stencil buffer. - DONE

13. Implement reaction to colliding with a face. Some kind of sliding will do. - DONE

14. Implement framerate display and consistent movement independent of framerate using Paul Nettles advice. Also look at altering timer increment to do shift and control key speed changes

15. Turn off all comment pragma warning ignores and update all my commenting manually : intellisense does a good job of helping - DONE

16. Implement angle sumation technique for collision detection as alternative to classification of intersection point with edge planes

17. Write some unittests for D3Vect in the utilities project

18. Use Engine namespace in Engine project - DONE

19. Fix bounding boxes not drawing - DONE

20. Implement bounding box caching in vrml files - DONE

21. Extend loading screen to have a scrollbar for the actual map read. Can accomplish this by getting a file length and comparing it to the current line we just read. Shouldn't be too bad
to add this. It will be the first progress bar before the potential boundingbox progress bar. - DONE

22. Address progress dialog going into not responding mode at seemingly random times although it mainly happens on large maps. Maybe adjust the priority of the background worker
and main thread. - DONE

23. Replace List<T> usage with HashSets where sorting isn't done - ABANDONED BECAUSE HASHSET DOESN'T HAVE AN INDEXER

24. Move Simulator designer code code to a newly minted Simulator.Designer.cs - DONE

25. Implement easy up and down movement. Spacebar goes down and midmouse goes up - DONE

26. Create zip file for all textures and maps and extract from it at read time to load maps

27. Implement wix installer
