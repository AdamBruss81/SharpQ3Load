This is a record of the cases that have been completed or require completion in the future

1. Transfer simulator to tao framework - DONE

2. Reformat code style - DONE, fix upside down textures - DONE
 
3. Remove all casting and replace with templatized lists using the List collection class. Also use members when possible
instead of allocating memory. - DONE, smooth and speed up texturing. using mipmaps things look pretty good. Game moves very slow still
Will try to alter structural aspects of game to speed things up. -DONE

4. Remove all texture flickering. This is most noticable when turning orientation with mouse turns. -DONE 

CollisionDetection-1 : reinstate collision detection - DONE, Tune up collision detection for faster performance, remove all unnecessary allocation of memory
Do it once at load time - DONE but still slow. will try better keyboard movement techniques - DONE

5. Re-import all Quake 3 stock textures and effects from raw pak data. Don't need to convert any images this time because I think C# can read in pngs

6. Implement crude effects for projectiles. Basic idea is to do something cool looking that sticks with projectile as it moves

7. Implement sound emanating from projectile - DONE

8. Handle long map name when it doesn't exist. Remove "aka" before the available map name - DONE

9. Holding shift key flies faster - DONE

10. Wait cursor for map load. And a loading screen that at a minimum displays the status of the bounding box creation and map reading - DONE

11. Collision Detection-2 : Improve collision detection coverage and speed. - DONE

12. Implement a help screen to display what all the keys and mouse commands do. Either do a windows style dialog or something fancier with the stencil buffer. - DONE

13. Implement reaction to colliding with a face. Some kind of sliding will do. - DONE

14. Implement framerate display and consistent movement independent of framerate using Paul Nettles advice. Also look at altering timer increment to do shift and control key speed changes

15. Turn off all comment pragma warning ignores and update all my commenting manually : intellisense does a good job of helping - DONE

16. Implement angle sumation technique for collision detection as alternative to classification of intersection point with edge planes

17. Write some unittests for D3Vect in the utilities project

18. Use Engine namespace in Engine project - DONE

19. Fix bounding boxes not drawing - DONE

20. Implement bounding box caching in vrml files - DONE

21. Extend loading screen to have a scrollbar for the actual map read. Can accomplish this by getting a file length and comparing it to the current line we just read. Shouldn't be too bad
to add this. It will be the first progress bar before the potential boundingbox progress bar. - DONE

22. Address progress dialog going into not responding mode at seemingly random times although it mainly happens on large maps. Maybe adjust the priority of the background worker
and main thread. - DONE

23. Replace List<T> usage with HashSets where sorting isn't done - ABANDONED BECAUSE HASHSET DOESN'T HAVE AN INDEXER

24. Move Simulator designer code code to a newly minted Simulator.Designer.cs - DONE

25. Implement easy up and down movement. Spacebar goes down and midmouse goes up - DONE

26. Create zip file for all textures and maps and extract from it at read time to load maps

27. Implement wix installer

----------------------

Current movement issue. While moving forward, if you continue to move forward and press left, it delays before starting the strafe run. I think pressing left makes it accelerate
from 0 instead of taking your existing speed. Conversely, when you start moving it takes 1.5 as the scale to base your first move off which is wrong. I need to switch these and then make the get
accelscale function handle it correctly.

---------

I'm aborting the diagnol movement system and going back to just four movements with strafe running doing two movements each tick. This is just way easier to do with acceleration 
because you just need the four stopwatches and you're pretty much done. To deal with the bumpy strafe running along wall issue, I plan on detected when two collisions in one tick
happens. If that does happen, restore the camera to where it was at the start of the tick and do a diagnol move. This will then respond smoothly along the wall. So diagnol
movement will be a special case.

Also I think I will need four current velocities rather than one. I need to know which way I'm accelerating or decelerating. If you're running forward full speed
and hit left, it should accelerate you left and not start you left at fullspeed.

---------------------------

I ran into a bug in the collision detection system while jumping around into walls. I've known it's been there for a while but never saw it cause a real problem in game. When I call canmove,
I'm using the default lookat. I need to use the scales look at which is where the player will actually go if the canmove succeeds. This will probably
require moving some code around. So CanMove needs to take the actual soon to be moved scaled lookat and not the default one. When you're going fast this will have the 
effect of stopping you far from a wall. In this case move to the minimum allowable distance from the wall. So you won't move the full distance of the fast move. You'll
move enough to be close to the wall.

Turn off collision detection for fog faces and doors. For example in hero's keep.

The jumping jumps too high and too fast up I think. It should level out but keep you in the air longer. This way you can jump longer without having to go so high.

Get jumppads to work. Shouldn't be hard. Just detect when you collide with one going down(falling) and then trigger a high jump in the direction of the normal of the jumppad face.

Get lower volume working for music.

When moving left and right... If moving left and you hit right, stop the left decel timer instead of letting it playout. There is too much play in the movement left to right 
at the moment. Front to back is ok. Can improve air travel by reducing the friction in the air and also lessening movement amounts user inputs while in the air.

Only play footsteps if you're moving at a good clip. Not if you say tap forward quickly.
